i tried to search how to open an encase file.

finally setelled for access data FTK imager.
download this software on windows (28MB).

just simply opened it and mount the image for a new drive.
open the drive a find all the file and file structure similar to windows.

since the question hints towards contacts, there we find the contacts folder.
it has a lot of files with extension .contact and we know this is a type of file that windows save for contacts.
try to open it in windows contacts and in certain files we can find notes written where we can find the parts of the flag.

flag: darkCTF{C0ntacts_4re_1mp0rtant}
