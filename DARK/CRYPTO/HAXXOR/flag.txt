the question hints at xor being the cipher but we need to find the key.

using cyber chef for all the procedure.

given was the string in hex and we knew that the flag starts with "darkCTF{" so this becomes our key to find the actual key.

this is shown in the find-key.png file.

now we know that the key os 1337hack.

using this as the actual key as shown in the flag.png we get the flag.

flag: darkCTF{kud0s_h4xx0r}
